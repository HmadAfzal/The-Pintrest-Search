# The-Pintrest-Search

This is a simple Pinterest clone project demonstrating how to create a search bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

The Pinterest clone search bar allows users to input keywords and search for relevant pins. When a user types a query into the search bar JavaScript retrieves data from a predefined list of pins and filters out pins that do not match the search query. The filtered pins are then displayed on the page.

## Features
- **Home page clone:** Created a clone of home page.
- **Search Bar:** Users can input keywords into the search bar.
- **Filtered Results:** Pins that match the search query are displayed on the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The search bar is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Markup language for creating the structure of the search bar.
- **CSS:** Styling language for designing the layout and appearance of the search bar.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language for adding interactivity to the search bar.

## Usage

To use the Pinterest clone search bar:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Type a search query into the search bar.
4. View the filtered results displayed on the page.
